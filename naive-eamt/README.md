# Naïve-EAMT: Naïve Entity Aware Machine Translation Framework

This project aims to provide a configurable machine translation architecture. Through this architecture one could combine various implementations of Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation tools with Neural Machine Translation to form an end-to-end entity aware machine translation RESTful service.

It comes already integrated with the following tools:

<!-- Table including all the integrated NER, EL and MT tools -->
*There will a table here instead of this text, soon.*

<!-- ## Normal Setup
